Hi.

The code in this folder was from a coding sprint. There was code that was provided which had only 2 space tabs rather than 4, so it gets a bit messy.

The CodeSprintLib file was something I wrote just before the beginning of the assessment. It seems to come in handy somewhat.

Thanks for reading!
