# local-code-portfolio
This is a repo that holds code that I have written but not put on GitHub. There is a mix of C++, Java and HTML among others.

# dev.tar.gz
Yeah... there were so many files that GitHub wouldn't let me upload them. There was also a problem with the .zip compression. It kept telling me that there was corrupted files. So I opted for taz.gz. You might have to download it and extract it manually. Sorry!
